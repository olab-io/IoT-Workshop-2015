❤ openLab IoT Workshop ❤
=========================
### 14 February, 2015

_Welcome to the 2015 openLab / Media Futures Internet of Things (IoT) Workshop! In this workshop we'll explore some of the concepts driving the "Internet of Things," and some new inexpensive technologies that will allow you to add your "thing" to the internet of "things"._

## Workshop Agenda
- 09:00 - 09:30 Arrive, serve each other coffee, make friends, scheme.
- 09:30 - 10:00 Grab your new friend and set up a workstation together.
- 10:00 - 10:15 "Ok, what is the internet of things?"
- 10:15 - 10:30 "Wait -- what? Show me some examples."
- 10:30 - 11:00 "Now, how do do I make something like that?"
- 11:00 - 11:15 "I need to take a break for a minute."
- 11:15 - 12:00 Talk about possible projects for the afternoon.
- 12:00 - 13:30 Take a long lunch, talk about ideas, come back prepared to share what you want to do in the afternoon.
- 13:30 - 13:45 Working group mini presentations (3 sentences about what you are going to make).
- 13:45 - 16:30 Make it!
- 16:30 - 17:00 Show and tell.

## Things You'll Need
_Don't worry, we'll provide it or find someone to share it with you if you didn't bring it ..._
- A laptop with the following software:
    - [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/) The primary microcontroller programming environment we'll be using.
    - [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) A great program for designing,  visualizing and sharing circuits.
    - [CoolTerm](http://freeware.the-meiers.org/) A really reliable serial console.  This allows you to talk directly to serial devices.
- An Arduino
  - For our demos we'll be using an Arduino UNO.  Other Arduinos will work just fine.  Arduinos with 3.3v logic (like https://www.adafruit.com/product/1500) are even better if you've got one.  Just ask your neighbor if you're not sure what you have.  If your neighbor doesn't know, ask someone else at your table.
  - A [breadboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard).  There are lots of different kinds.  Most any will work.  Just be aware that sometimes the long tracks on the edges are not always exactly the same on all boards.
  - Some jumper wires to hook everything up.  You can use your own or we'll provide solid core wire and wire strippers / clippers so you can make your own.
  - An [ESP8266](http://www.esp8266.com/wiki/doku.php) Wifi board.  We are using the `01` variant.  
  - A voltage regulator and other components to power the Wifi board.  We will be using an [LM317](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LM317) voltage regulator, the 220Ω and 330Ω resistors to configure it for 3.125v output and the decoupling capacitors to remove input noise and output transients.
 - Some sensors or other related projects to work on.
 - Power strips / surge protector if you have one to share.
